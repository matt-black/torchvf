Setup Notes
===

Config files require `ml_collections` (https://github.com/google/ml_collections)

To install this library into the environment for development: `pip install --editable .` from the root directory (same as `pyproject.toml`). 

Download the datasets from: https://osf.io/xmury/ and then arrange them as described in the README. 
My code changes here should be compatible with making everything else work...
